In particular, you should write about:

The hand-in should be written in **English**.

Heroku deployed app:
https://whispering-temple-19063.herokuapp.com/

1.  I encountered a few problems
- Installing maven correctly and fixing the JAVA_HOME
- installing Heroku. I tried their recommended aproach with snap. This did not work at all first snap gave me alot of problems, after installation it would not download heroku. In the end I ended up using AUR to fetch heroku, and did not have any problems afterwards. 

2.  checked with jdk --version and mvn --version, afterwards I followed the instructions and since everything worked fine, both locally on localhost::5000 and online on https://whispering-temple-19063.herokuapp.com/
3.  None after installation.
4.  None
